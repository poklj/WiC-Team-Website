		<h2>Stressors and How To Identify Them</h2>
		<article>
			<h3>Stressors: A Primer</h3>
			<p>We live stressful lives, where anything from health, emotions, relationships or money can send us over the edge. 
			While a little bit a stress is proven to increase your productivity, too much stress can cause you to lose sleep, procrasinate and be unpleasant to others. 
			While we can't avoid stress entirely in our lives, identifying what causes us stress is a good first step.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Examples of Stressors</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Do you find that you are constantly afraid about money?</p></li>
				<li><p>Do you feel like there isn't enough time to finish everything you need and want to do?</p></li>
				<li><p>Do you constantly worry about getting sick?</p></li>
				<li><p>Do you have issues eating or exercising?</p></li>
				<li><p>Do you feel like you never get to take breaks?</p></li>
			</ul>
			</p>All of these are example of stressors. Not everything stresses everyone the same way however, one individual might 
			never worry have to worry about their budget, while someone else frets over every penny spent. You shouldn't feel 
			shame for being like this however - nobody can control what stresses them out.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>The Goal</h3>
			<p>The goal is not to remove the areas that stress you from your life - that is both impratical and likely to cause you more damage. 
			The goal is to first find out where your issues lie so that you can then work to make them better.
			We all have aspects of our lifes that we struggle with - struggle is an inherient part of life. 
			Working to make ourselves better should be our goal, not to dwell on inadequecy.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>The Next Step</h3>
			<p>Once you figure out where your stressors lie, try to slowly change yourself for the better - for example; if you are worried about exercise, try to get in a little bit each morning.
			There are tons of sources online, with many tips to help you become better and other people who have experianced the same issues.
			It will be hard at the beginning and you might want to give up, but it will get easier everyday.</p>
