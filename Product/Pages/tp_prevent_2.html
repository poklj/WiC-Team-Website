		<h2>Common Things That Prevent People From Higher Education</h2>

			<h3>Other Obligations</h3>
			<p>We all have our lives to live, and school unfortunately isn't the only obligation we have throughout our week. 
			Whether it be work, family, friends or hobbies we all have important tasks to do outside of school.
			If you fear you will not have time to finish your course load, consider the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><p>If you don't believe you will be able to both work and go to school, 
				note that there are options to get financial aid so you can focus on your studies.</p></li>
				<li><p>If you aren't able to physically attend school, 
				consider signing up for NSCC online courses instead - 
				they are partical knowledge and skill courses that you can do 
				from the confort of your home that might be more appealing.</p></li>
				<li><p>Consider that you might not be ready to start an acedemic career - 
				don't force yourself into a stressful situation you won't be able to finish. 
				It might be better to get yourself into a more stable situation where you 
				can go to school without worrying that you won't be able to do something else.</p></li>
			</ol>
			</div>
			<div class="p2">
			<h3>Money</h3>
			<p>Money plays a big part into most things we wish we could do but can't - 
			school is unfortunately no different. There are options available to you 
			if you think money is going to be a problem:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><p>NSCC has avaliable to students reward options and financial aid for 
				those in dire straits. You can also take a student loan out to fund your education.</p></li>
				<li><p>Education can be important for your goals and as such one should 
				try to see what they can cut to afford it - the ability to budget is a 
				skill that is important not only for school, but for life in general. 
				There are numerious resources online that can help you do just that.</p></li>
				<li><p>Make sure you do your research and carefully consider why you 
				want to go to school in the first place - what are you hoping to 
				accomplish? It can be easy to assume one needs education to be successful 
				in life but it can be disasterous to run yourself into financial ruin 
				just to find out the course you took doesn't actually help you.</p></li>
			</ol>
