				<h3>Unstable Due to Sleep</h3>
				<p>A common issue for students is an inability to manage sleep time,
				resulting in oversleeping, falling asleep during class and being 
				unable to finish homework. If you are worried about or currently 
				experiencing these issues happening to you, here are some tips:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><p>Living the technological age that we do, we are surrounded by mobile techonology 
					and usually have it accompany us to bed. Artificial light from electronic devices has 
					been proven to negatively impact our sleeping habits, making it more difficult to get 
					a a consistant sleep schedule. Try limiting your exposure to your screen around bedtime.</p></li>
					<li><p>Have you ever woken up in the middle of the night and had trouble returning to sleep?
					Consider bring a novel or headset to bed - light reading and listening to music until you
					feel yourself getting sleepy again are a lot more effective than trying to force yourself to sleep.</p></li>
					<li><p>Try to get a little bit of exercise each morning when you get up - not only is exercising known
					to make sleeping easier and more refreshing, but you will feel more alert during your school day.</p></li>
					<li><p>While you may be inclined to try napping after school, late afternoon napping will only further weaken your sleep schedule.</p></li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Unstable Due to Work Load</h3>
				<p>School is not easy - there is a lot of expectation and pressure on you to keep up to date on 
				learning and getting assignments done on time which can lead to giving up. If you feel like you 
				won't be able to handle serious workloads, here are some tips that can help:
				<ol>
					<li><p>It is easy to feel like you are falling behind on tasks - that can be really demoralizing and 
					can lead to procrasination. Maintaining a planner, calendar, or a simple to-do list is an effective 
					way to keep track of what is expected of you abd by when. Crossing things off can be very therupatic 
					if you have been stressing about certain assignments.</p></li>
					<li><p>Remember to have fun - working every moment of your spare time on school and work will only 
					burn you out, make you miserable and reduce the quality of your work.</p></li>
					<li><p>If you are having difficulty understanding a subject, do not be afraid to ask your teachers 
					for help - it is why they are there. Teachers are generally veru understanding of colledge pressures
					as they have had to go through school as well and will generally give you extra time if needed so long
					as you are not demanding or unrealistic.</p></li>
					<li><p>If you are starting to feel overwhelmed remember that your fellow classmates are in the dame boat as you.
					They might have strategies you are not aware of that could help tremendously, or alternatively you might be able
					to help them as well. Building relationships early in the year can lead to strong teammates later on.</p></li>
